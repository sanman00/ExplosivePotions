This Minecraft mod's source code ("the code") is ©2015 sanman00 ("the author") all rights reserved, and is licensed for use and redistribution under a modification of the “Don’t Be a Jerk” non-commercial care-free licence.

###Scope
This means that you’re free to pretty much do what you like with the the code (source) or compiled binaries (jar/zip/class files), including but not limited to:
* Download code or compiled binaries for personal use
* Put the code or compiled binaries into your modpack
* Fork this repository
* Compile the code
* Modify the code to: 
  * Fix bugs 
  * Add features 
  * Fit better with your modpack
  * Remove a problematic item
  * Replace all item icons with cat pictures if you really wanted to (preferably not, though)
* Use portions of the code as examples in a presentation
* Record portions of gameplay for display on YouTube or other video/media sites

The above usage is granted to you as long as this license remains intact for all original or derived code. Please include a copy of this license with the code, or provide a link to this document, just to make sure everyone's as cool as you.

###Ownership
This licence specifically prohibits you from claiming the the code or compiled binaries are your own without permission from me. 

###Non-Commercial Status
You are expressly prohibited from making or trying to make money from the code, derivatives of the code, compiled portions of the code, etc.

This license specifically prohibits you from using AdF.ly or AdF.ly clones (any "click past an ad before you can download" service) to make money or attempt to make money for clicks or downloads.

Specific exceptions to the non-commercial nature of this license are granted to any derivative works of art. Here's some specific exemptions:
* If you make a nice t-shirt design based off the code and want to sell that, that's fine.
* Want to use the the code or compiled binaries as part of a charity event? Go ahead.
* Make money from Let's Play videos or other "commentary" type uses, eg reviews or how-to videos/tutorials? No problem.

Ultimately, your work is your own. This license is designed to protect against douches trying to make money off someone else's work. Any exemptions not listed here require permission from me.

###Damages
This license prohibits any attempt to hold the author liable for damages caused by usage of the the code or compiled binaries. Bugs happen, so make backups, and don't complain if your world gets corrupted. Seriously, make backups.

###Reserved Rights
I reserve the right to change this license at any time (not I really will make many changes).

Conclusion
====
Ultimately, don't be an idiot, play nice, be polite, and you'll be fine.
